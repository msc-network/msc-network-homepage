        A new simple, small and clean Standard for Music Related Metadata
      </p>
      <p>
        Tackling the big, wide world of Music related metadata is a big task, if you have ever used any online services for your Record Label, Publishing House, Sync company or other Music Company then you will be aware of the problems facing transmitting Metadata between all these different services. We are working towards a simple and open standard.
